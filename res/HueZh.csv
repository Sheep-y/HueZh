VO/Intro0,"Dearest Hue,",
VO/Intro1,"Oh, I've had the most dreadful luck.",
VO/Intro2,I feel terrible that you've been left alone all this time.,
VO/Intro3,The traitorous Dr. Grey tried to steal the Annular Spectrum - a ring I developed to allow perception and alteration of colour.,
VO/Intro4,Some call them impossible colours. Hah! Impossible for Dr. Grey maybe.,
VO/Intro5,"Anyway, something went wrong.",
VO/Intro6,I turned a strange shade and became invisible.,
VO/Intro7,"The ring... it fractured, scattering coloured shards far and wide.",
VO/Intro8,"I stayed at home for many weeks, watching, waiting.",
VO/Intro9,"Existing on this coloured plane, I couldn't speak to you, nor interact with anything in the mono-world.",
VO/Intro10,So I left. I left for the University where I hid away the coloured tools I had created.,
VO/Intro11,I pray you have found what is left of the ring.,
VO/Aqua0,"Since the beginning, we have pointed to the sky and declared it blue.",
VO/Aqua1,"It is this shared vision, this unquestioned understanding which connects us.",
VO/Aqua2,But are you really seeing blue the same way I see it?,
VO/Aqua3,Perhaps blue is nothing more than a shade of grey to you.,
VO/Aqua4,Perhaps everyone in this world sees nothing but shades of grey.,
VO/Aqua5,Don't you see Hue? This... this is why we're here.,
VO/Water0,"When you enter a cave expecting a waterfall, the chances are your expectations will be met.",
VO/Water1,"But if you discard those expectations, don't you think instead, the cave will be full of surprises?",
VO/Water2,"I ask for you, Hue, to abandon your expectations.",
VO/Water3,To pull me back from the brink of unreality...,
VO/Water4,I need you to see the world not for what it is... but for what it can be.,
VO/Purple0,"Did you know, Hue, that purple is at the very end of the visible spectrum?",
VO/Purple1,It's the hardest colour for our eyes to distinguish.,
VO/Purple2,Now imagine... a shade one step further than purple..,
VO/Purple3,A colour beyond what we can actually perceive.,
VO/Purple4,We call these impossible colours...,
VO/Purple5,and I fear that this... this is where I currently reside.,
VO/Purple6,"If reality is rooted in our perception and you cannot perceive me, do I even exist to you?",
VO/Purple7,"I'm sure that I do, I mean, you're reading this letter, or at least... I hope you are.",
VO/Purple8,I'm sorry but... existing in this strange state of impermanence does funny things to you Hue.,
VO/Purple9,It makes you question... what is real?,
VO/Orange0,"The University gardens were bathed in an earthy, orange light when I first met Dr. Grey.",
VO/Orange1,"Summer had come and gone, and a cold autumnal crispness had caught me off guard.",
VO/Orange2,"I sat on the grass, surrounded by my books and papers, when a cool breeze threatened to blow my notes across the lawn.",
VO/Orange3,A page escaped my reach and took flight.,
VO/Orange4,"A man not much older than myself chased after it, catching it on his third or fourth attempt.",
VO/Orange5,I remember his gentle smile when he returned it.,
VO/Orange6,He started talking and I was surprised that he had read my work in the University journal.,
VO/Orange7,"He said he was a professor, and that... he hoped we could work together someday.",
VO/Orange8,It's funny Hue... how something so small... can change so much.,
VO/Fire0,Dr. Grey soon became my assigned mentor and... I can't help but feel he somehow had a hand in it.,
VO/Fire1,Our fires burnt brightest when we worked together. It felt like we could achieve anything.,
VO/Fire2,We discovered more about colour than I could ever have imagined.,
VO/Fire3,"We split light, mapped spectrums, we painted, we laughed... we worked long hours, and soon our goal became all-consuming.",
VO/Fire4,"We were vessels. The work became more important than us, and we knew it.",
VO/Pink0,"It's funny, I don't remember much after that day on the grass.",
VO/Pink1,I do know that Dr. Grey and I spent many a time together.,
VO/Pink2,"I would compliment him on his work, and his cheeks would flush with a pinkness, hah!",
VO/Pink3,"He'd notice and change the subject, embarrassed.",
VO/Pink4,This work we were doing together... it didn't feel much like work any more.,
VO/Red0,"Did you know, Hue, that every language first has a word for black and for white, for dark and for light?",
VO/Red1,The first colour described afterwards is always... red. The colour of blood and wine. The colour of anger.,
VO/Red2,"The anger I felt... when, I was told my experiments had gone too far.",
VO/Red3,"When Dr. Grey sided with the University, stopping my research altogether.",
VO/Red4,"For all our languages, for all our ways to communicate, it's funny how sometimes we simply cannot.",
VO/Red5,It leads people to do things they regret.,
VO/Red6,"To steal, to break, to forget what is important.",
VO/Temple0,"Once a seed has taken root, it doesn't take long for it to grow, to nurture and blossom into something beautiful.",
VO/Temple1,"The seed of knowledge was planted in my mind, and I wasn't prepared to let it wilt and die.",
VO/Temple2,The University claimed my experiments were unethical. That altering the fabric of our reality was dangerous.,
VO/Temple3,They were unflinching. My research was confiscated and my contract terminated.,
VO/Temple4,"Following my expulsion, I was left with no choice but to uproot, and move us both far away.",
VO/Temple5,"I knew of a small fishing village, a boat ride from The University, where I hoped my reputation wouldn't precede me.",
VO/Temple6,"You and I moved into a humble home, which is now where you've spent most of your childhood.",
VO/Blue0,"Do you recall those dusty old tomes that used to sit on my desk? The ancient scriptures, of civilisations lost?",
VO/Blue1,"I spent hours poring over them, searching for clues to support my research.",
VO/Blue2,"Aside from their wonders, one thing stood out above all else... blue. Or more specifically, the absence of it.",
VO/Blue3,"Other colours were detailed at length; but not blue, it was never mentioned at all. The word simply didn’t exist.",
VO/Blue4,"Could they not distinguish blue? Without a word to describe it, how can we be sure they could see it at all?",
VO/Yellow0,Spring was around the corner. Yellow daffodils poked through the dirt in our backyard.,
VO/Yellow1,"As time moved, my resentment slowly slipped away.",
VO/Yellow2,"I continued my research from home. Without Dr. Grey, work was slow, but I still made progress.",
VO/Yellow3,"One day, Hue, when you were sleeping... I watched over you.",
VO/Yellow4,"I was on the cusp of a breakthrough, and you were the last person left to see it.",
VO/Yellow5,I was so excited... for the both of us.,
VO/Tech0,My research led me to tales of a long lost civilisation.,
VO/Tech1,They built great machines... pioneering electricity many years before we discovered it.,
VO/Tech2,"Strangely though, this civilisation is said to have felt no pain.",
VO/Tech3,"They knew of pain, and observed it, yet could not experience it themselves.",
VO/Tech4,"Explaining to them the sensation of pain, is like me explaining colour...",
VO/Tech5,...to someone that can only see in black and white.,
VO/Tech6,"I wonder Hue, if we will be able to share in our experiences of colour.",
VO/Lime0,The first time I wore the ring... I could see a coloured image of the sun.,
VO/Lime1,"Aqua, purple, orange, pink, red, blue, yellow and green.",
VO/Lime2,Great fireworks played out across the backdrop to my reality.,
VO/Lime3,"Was I dreaming? Was I alive? My senses, dulled from a lifetime of monotone, struggled with the revelation.",
VO/Lime4,Time eased. Colours danced in slow motion... like Pollock painting a ballet on the moon.,
VO/Lime5,I removed the ring and time slipped back to normal.,
VO/Lime6,"Colour dissolved into grey. It was overwhelming, but what followed affected me the most.",
VO/Lime7,"After seeing in colour for the first time, when everything returned to normal, I could remember in colour.",
VO/Lime8,I had never once before had a coloured memory.,
VO/TechEnd0,"The more I experienced, the more I realised how little I was experiencing.",
VO/TechEnd1,"Seeing the world in true colour, was not true at all.",
VO/TechEnd2,The goalposts had just been moved a little further down an infinite playing field.,
VO/TechEnd3,"These shades... they are a paradigm away from what I could ever imagine, and yet, how much more there must be! ",
VO/TechEnd4,"Is there ever such a thing as true reality, Hue? Does truth exist in our minds, the same way that colour does?",
VO/TechEnd5,Maybe next I'll stumble upon a third-dimension. Hah! Could you imagine?!,
VO/Mountains0,"If a tree stands in the woods, and nobody is there to see it, does that tree exist?",
VO/Mountains1,Does it have colour and form? Does it matter?,
VO/Mountains2,"This journey has been difficult, Hue, and whilst I have trodden a lost, winding path...",
VO/Mountains3,...I feel no closer to the truth I was after. No matter how long you chase the moon...,
VO/Mountains4,"If truth does exist in our minds, then I feel there may be one that I have neglected.",
VO/Mountains5,"All this time, you've been alone, and now uprooted, on a journey for my cause.",
VO/Mountains6,For what? So I could see the world a little clearer?,
VO/Mountains7,"I do hope in the end, it was worth it. For both of us.",
VO/UniversityStart0,"Being back at the University has surfaced many memories, Hue.",
VO/UniversityStart1,I remember taking you to lectures... you would crawl to the front of the hall when I wasn’t paying attention.,
VO/UniversityStart2,"Dr. Grey would look down from his lectern, and all his seriousness and authority would wash away.",
VO/UniversityStart3,"He would pick you up, walk over and return you to my arms with a smile.",
VO/UniversityStart4,"Love cannot be measured, Hue. Like colour, it exists inside of us. I buried it.",
VO/UniversityStart5,"I buried the love that I had, for my own ends. I hope, after all this, you will see my mistakes for what they are.",
VO/UniversityStart6,"Yours lovingly, Mum.",
VO/UniversityEnd0,"Dearest Hue, it has been too long. You have grown so much.",
VO/UniversityEnd1,Your mother... I tried to warn her.,
VO/UniversityEnd2,I thought that exiling her from the University would protect her... would protect you...,
VO/UniversityEnd3,She did not understand that some people choose not to see.,
VO/UniversityEnd4,"I never stole the ring from her, Hue. I tried to destroy it... before it destroyed her.",
VO/UniversityEnd5,I now know she had it under control. She knew what she was doing.,
VO/UniversityEnd6,"My intervention shattered the ring, altering your mother's very fabric.",
VO/UniversityEnd7,"My only reprieve, is that you were able to follow in her footsteps... to experience her work first-hand.",
VO/UniversityEnd8,"We do not see things as they are Hue, instead we see them as we are.",
VO/UniversityEnd9,Your mother... she has been waiting for you. I expect she will be thrilled to see how far you've come.,
VO/PS0,"P.S. You cannot always control what happens to you, but you can choose how you see it.",
VO/PS1,"Now you can see true colour, you must decide if it is for better or worse.",
VO/PS2,"I hope, after all this, it is for the better.",
