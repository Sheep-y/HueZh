LighthouseKeeperIntroA0,The fishermen caught a glimpse of something...,漁夫們
LighthouseKeeperIntroA1,...something unusual.,
LighthouseKeeperIntroA2,Down past the lighthouse.,
LighthouseKeeperIntroB0,Your mother has gone?,
LighthouseKeeperIntroB1,Oh I'm sure she'll be back,
LighthouseKeeperIntroB2,I haven't seen her myself I'm afraid.,
LighthouseKeeperIntroC0,What a miserable day!,
LighthouseKeeperIntroC1,The lighthouse is on the blink as well!,
LighthouseKeeperIntroC2,No boats can can come inshore...,
LighthouseKeeperIntroC3,...until it's working again.,
LighthouseKeeperIntroC4,What a bother!,
LighthouseKeeperAquaA0,"Wow, the skies have cleared...",
LighthouseKeeperAquaA1,...what a beautiful day.,
LighthouseKeeperAquaB0,Now if only I could figure out...,
LighthouseKeeperAquaB1,...What is wrong with the lighthouse...,
LighthouseKeeperAquaB2,Then the fishermen would know where to come!,
LighthouseKeeperAquaC0,We used to turn on the power in the basement...,
LighthouseKeeperAquaC1,...but the entrance has long been blocked.,
LighthouseKeeperAquaC2,"There is another secret entrance, but...",
LighthouseKeeperAquaC3,...that comes out a long way from here.,
LighthouseKeeperLighthouseOn0,The light has come on!,
LighthouseKeeperLighthouseOn1,Finally the boats can come in to harbor.,
LighthouseKeeperLighthouseOnOutsideA0,"Hey Hue, it was you?",
LighthouseKeeperLighthouseOnOutsideA1,You turned the power back on?,
LighthouseKeeperLighthouseOnOutsideA2,Well I'll be. Thank you!,
LighthouseKeeperLighthouseOnOutsideA3,The fishermen are back now...,
LighthouseKeeperLighthouseOnOutsideA4,...they got quite lost I believe!,
LighthouseKeeperLighthouseOnOutsideB0,Now the lighthouse is working...,
LighthouseKeeperLighthouseOnOutsideB1,...boats can come and go again!,
LighthouseKeeperLighthouseOnOutsideB2,If you need a ride anywhere...,
LighthouseKeeperLighthouseOnOutsideB3,I'm sure the fishermen will oblige!,
LighthouseKeeperLighthouseOnOutsideC0,You'd think keeping a lighthouse would be easy...,
LighthouseKeeperLighthouseOnOutsideC1,But with the power going out...,
LighthouseKeeperLighthouseOnOutsideC2,...and the basement getting blocked...,
LighthouseKeeperLighthouseOnOutsideC3,...well... it's been quite stressful!,
LighthouseKeeperLighthouseOnOutsideC4,"I need a nice cup of tea, and a snooze.",
LighthouseKeeperCompleteA0,"Your mother is back, Hue!",
LighthouseKeeperCompleteA1,Wonderful!,
LighthouseKeeperCompleteA2,What a relief it must be.,
LighthouseKeeperCompleteB0,My mother left long ago.,
LighthouseKeeperCompleteB1,I'm so pleased you were able to find yours.,
LighthouseKeeperCompleteB2,"Make sure you make the most of it, Hue.",
LighthouseKeeperCompleteC0,"First, the lighthouse, now your mother...",
LighthouseKeeperCompleteC1,...what a remarkable day!,
LighthouseKeeperCompleteC2,I hope this spell of good luck continues!,
MinerIntroA0,Hellooooo?,
MinerIntroA1,Hue is that you?,
MinerIntroA2,"Thank goodness, I've been trapped for days!",
MinerIntroA3,Help me get out of here!,
MinerIntroA4,I keep hearing noises! It's creeping me out!,
MinerAquaA0,The rocks... they...,
MinerAquaA1,they... just disappeared?,
MinerAquaA2,I don't know how you did it?,
MinerAquaA3,Who cares! I'm saved!,
MinerAquaA4,Thank you!,
MinerHomeA0,"Oh, hey again Hue!",
MinerHomeA1,Thanks so much for saving me earlier!,
MinerHomeA2,Those caves sure gave me the creeps.,
MinerHomeB0,I don't know how much longer I would have lasted...,
MinerHomeB1,...the rocks had trapped me in!,
MinerHomeB2,What a pickle!,
MinerHomeC0,"How did you do it though, Hue?",
MinerHomeC1,You made the rocks... just vanish.,
MinerHomeC2,Was it magic... witchcraft?,
MinerHomeD0,Perhaps you can make my bills disappear too...,
MinerHomeD1,...wouldn't that be something!,
MinerCompleteA0,Hey Hue! You saved your mother too?,
MinerCompleteA1,Or did she save you?,
MinerCompleteA2,It must be your new...,
MinerCompleteA3,"...mysterious powers, woOOoo.",
MinerCompleteB0,I told your mother about how you saved me...,
MinerCompleteB1,she was so proud!,
MinerCompleteB2,"Rightfully so, I owe you a beer...",
MinerCompleteB3,...I mean a juice!,
MinerCompleteC0,I'm hanging up my mining boots for good!,
MinerCompleteC1,I never found anything anyway...,
MinerCompleteC2,...I might look for shells on the beach instead.,
WaterLadyA0,Oh hello there!,
WaterLadyA1,You startled me...,
WaterLadyA2,I'm just resting my legs...,
WaterLadyA3,Don't play too close to the water now!,
WaterLadyB0,I've heard there are caves through the waterfall...,
WaterLadyB1,...apparently they stretch for miles.,
WaterLadyB2,I would never go myself though.,
WaterLadyB3,It's far too dangerous!,
WaterLadyC0,I come down here to collect water sometimes...,
WaterLadyC1,...it's much nicer than from the well.,
WaterLadyC2,Isn't the sound of water relaxing?,
WaterLadyC3,I could just sit here and listen all day.,
WaterLadyHomeA0,Hello again Hue.,
WaterLadyHomeA1,Great to see you and your mother are safe!,
WaterLadyHomeA2,Hopefully we'll cross paths...,
WaterLadyHomeA3,...maybe we can visit that waterfall again.,
WaterLadyHomeB0,"I had no idea when we last met, down by the waterfall...",
WaterLadyHomeB1,...that you were going on such an adventure!,
WaterLadyHomeB2,How exciting!,
WaterLadyHomeC0,"I would offer you a drink, but it's my last bottle!",
WaterLadyHomeC1,I need to take another trip to the waterfall.,
WaterLadyHomeC2,Maybe another day... today has been so busy!,
Skeleton1A0,Hey watch it buddy!,
Skeleton1B0,Stop that!,
Skeleton1C0,How could you be so heartless!,
Skeleton2A0,Skeletons hanging over here!,
Skeleton2B0,Quit it!,
Skeleton2C0,I'd come down there...,
Skeleton2C1,...but I don't have the guts!,
Skeleton3A0,You're not getting under my skin!,
Skeleton3B0,You're making me queasy...,
Skeleton3B1,I don't have the stomach for it.,
JanitorA0,"Oh hey, you!",
JanitorA1,You're not supposed to be here!,
JanitorA2,The University is closed...,
JanitorA3,"The pipes have burst, there's slime everywhere!",
JanitorA4,Best be on your way.,
JanitorB0,I won't say it again!,
JanitorB1,The University is closed!,
JanitorB2,Away with you!,
JanitorC0,Aren't you a bit young to be at University anyway?,
JanitorC1,I must be getting old.,
JanitorC2,"Now get out of here, before I lose my patience!",
JanitorD0,"Come on kid, I'm trying to mop up here.",
JanitorD1,"Don't cause a scene, I'm just doing my job.",
JanitorD2,Now scram!,
JanitorE0,"Okay, if you're going to hassle me, how about a joke?",
JanitorE1,What did the janitor say when he jumped out the closet?,
JanitorE2,Supplies!,
JanitorE3,Huehuehue...,
JanitorE4,Now scoot!,
FishermanVillageA0,Hey little landlubber!,
FishermanVillageA1,I'm just dropping off the catch.,
FishermanVillageA2,You need to get to the University?...,
FishermanVillageA3,...I'm setting sail shortly!,
FishermanVillageA4,Hop inside and I'll give you a ride!,
FishermanVillageB0,Not long until we set sail!,
FishermanVillageB1,Thank goodness the lighthouse is working now...,
FishermanVillageB2,...I was sailing around in circles!,
FishermanVillageB3,We'll raise anchor when you're ready!,
FishermanVillageC0,Nice day for a spot of sailing!,
FishermanVillageC1,Step inside and we'll hit the seas!,
FishermanMountainsA0,"Phew, that was a rough ride!",
FishermanMountainsA1,Looks like you found your sea legs though.,
FishermanMountainsA2,The University is up in the mountains...,
FishermanMountainsA3,"There should be a cable car, at the base of the mountain.",
FishermanMountainsA4,Otherwise you'll have a rocky climb!,
FishermanMountainsB0,"If you head East, you should see a sign for the University.",
FishermanMountainsB1,It shouldn't take you long to get there.,
FishermanMountainsB2,"I'll be here a while, so take your time.",
FishermanMountainsC0,It's a bit chilly isn't it?,
FishermanMountainsC1,I need to get a better coat.,
FishermanMountainsC2,Those seals have the right idea.,
FishermanMountainsC3,Eat enough fish to get nice and fat.,
FishermanMountainsC4,They look pretty warm under all that blubber.,
FishermanMountainsD0,Did you hear about the red ship that collided with the blue ship?,
FishermanMountainsD1,All the sailors were marooned!,
FishermanCompleteA0,Well I'll be... look who it is!,
FishermanCompleteA1,It's wonderful to see you both again!,
FishermanCompleteA2,I never doubted you'd find each other.,
FishermanCompleteA3,You both look exhausted... let me fire up the 'ol vessel.,
FishermanCompleteA4,I'll get you back to the village in no time.,
FishermanCompleteVillageA0,Hey little landlubber!,
FishermanCompleteVillageA1,It's so great to see you two reunited.,
FishermanCompleteVillageA2,You both slept the whole way back.,
FishermanCompleteVillageA3,You must have been so tired!,
FishermanCompleteVillageB0,I can take you back to the University...,
FishermanCompleteVillageB1,...did you leave something behind?,
FishermanCompleteVillageB2,I'm ready when you are!,
FishermanCompleteVillageC0,"It's a clear sky, perfect for a quick sail!",
FishermanCompleteVillageC1,Feel free to jump aboard.,
FishermanCompleteVillageC2,I need someone to scrub the deck!,
MumCompleteA0,Good morning Hue!,
MumCompleteA1,Isn't it great to be home...,
MumCompleteA2,...everything is back the way it should be.,
MumCompleteB0,When we arrived...,
MumCompleteB1,...everyone was so pleased to see us!,
MumCompleteB2,"I suppose, I kind of took our friends for granted...",
MumCompleteB3,...I was too caught up in my research.,
MumCompleteC0,I think my researching days are over...,
MumCompleteC1,"...or at least, I'm going to take a hiatus.",
MumCompleteC2,Never say never...,
MumCompleteC3,...even after everything we've been through!,
RepairmanA0,"Wow, you're a long way from home, kid!",
RepairmanA1,What are you doing all the way down here?,
RepairmanA2,I've just got this generator working.,
RepairmanA3,The lights have turned on!,
RepairmanB0,I read stories about an ancient civilisation...,
RepairmanB1,"...building great machines, many years ago.",
RepairmanB2,I came down here to see for myself.,
RepairmanB3,Quite incredible really!,
RepairmanC0,There's so many wires...,
RepairmanC1,...so much electricity!,
RepairmanC2,Keep an eye out for lasers.,
RepairmanC3,They're very dangerous!,
RepairmanCompleteA0,"Hey kid, great to see you again!",
RepairmanCompleteA1,Did you come across any more machines?,
RepairmanCompleteA2,I turned back at the lasers...,
RepairmanCompleteA3,I didn't want to get zapped!,
RepairmanCompleteB0,Quite the adventure you've been on!,
RepairmanCompleteB1,How you got through those lasers...,
RepairmanCompleteB2,"...you're a brave one, I'll give you that!",
RepairmanCompleteC0,We'll have to take a trip into the caves sometime...,
RepairmanCompleteC1,I'd love to see how you got so far!,
RepairmanCompleteC2,Not today though... I just got back!,
RepairmanCompleteC3,What a crazy few days!,
ShamanA0,H-h-h-heeeeey! Wheere d'ya think yeeer goin'?,
ShamanA1,Whaaat?,
ShamanA2,Who is that? Mmmhmmm.,
ShamanB0,Y-y-y-yessss! Faaalling rocks! Deeeath!,
ShamanB1,Go back! Back... back... back...,
ShamanB2,Whoooo?,
ShamanC0,N-n-n-noooo. Greeeaat ciiircles of air!,
ShamanC1,Stretch to the sky! Ahhhh!,
ShamanC2,Fly awaaay litttttle boy..,
LumberjackA0,Hey there little traveler.,
LumberjackA1,You look a long way from home...,
LumberjackA2,...what are you doing in these woods all alone?,
LumberjackA3,The cable car to the University is out of service.,
LumberjackA4,The only way is up through the mountains.,
LumberjackA5,"It's a dangerous climb, I wouldn't try it if I was you.",
LumberjackB0,I'm just gathering some fire wood.,
LumberjackB1,It gets cold at night in these mountains.,
LumberjackB2,Make sure you stay warm!,
LumberjackC0,I wonder what your business is at the University.,
LumberjackC1,"In the colder months, I collect firewood for them.",
LumberjackC2,"If you walk on past the entrance, I keep some wood in the rocks.",
LumberjackC3,Someone keeps putting this shiny beaker in there.,
LumberjackC4,Very strange.,
VO/Intro0,"Dearest Hue,",
VO/Intro1,"Oh, I've had the most dreadful luck.",
VO/Intro2,I feel terrible that you've been left alone all this time.,
VO/Intro3,The traitorous Dr. Grey tried to steal the Annular Spectrum - a ring I developed to allow perception and alteration of colour.,
VO/Intro4,Some call them impossible colours. Hah! Impossible for Dr. Grey maybe.,
VO/Intro5,"Anyway, something went wrong.",
VO/Intro6,I turned a strange shade and became invisible.,
VO/Intro7,"The ring... it fractured, scattering coloured shards far and wide.",
VO/Intro8,"I stayed at home for many weeks, watching, waiting.",
VO/Intro9,"Existing on this coloured plane, I couldn't speak to you, nor interact with anything in the mono-world.",
VO/Intro10,So I left. I left for the University where I hid away the coloured tools I had created.,
VO/Intro11,I pray you have found what is left of the ring.,
VO/Aqua0,"Since the beginning, we have pointed to the sky and declared it blue.",
VO/Aqua1,"It is this shared vision, this unquestioned understanding which connects us.",
VO/Aqua2,But are you really seeing blue the same way I see it?,
VO/Aqua3,Perhaps blue is nothing more than a shade of grey to you.,
VO/Aqua4,Perhaps everyone in this world sees nothing but shades of grey.,
VO/Aqua5,Don't you see Hue? This... this is why we're here.,
VO/Water0,"When you enter a cave expecting a waterfall, the chances are your expectations will be met.",
VO/Water1,"But if you discard those expectations, don't you think instead, the cave will be full of surprises?",
VO/Water2,"I ask for you, Hue, to abandon your expectations.",
VO/Water3,To pull me back from the brink of unreality...,
VO/Water4,I need you to see the world not for what it is... but for what it can be.,
VO/Purple0,"Did you know, Hue, that purple is at the very end of the visible spectrum?",
VO/Purple1,It's the hardest colour for our eyes to distinguish.,
VO/Purple2,Now imagine... a shade one step further than purple..,
VO/Purple3,A colour beyond what we can actually perceive.,
VO/Purple4,We call these impossible colours...,
VO/Purple5,and I fear that this... this is where I currently reside.,
VO/Purple6,"If reality is rooted in our perception and you cannot perceive me, do I even exist to you?",
VO/Purple7,"I'm sure that I do, I mean, you're reading this letter, or at least... I hope you are.",
VO/Purple8,I'm sorry but... existing in this strange state of impermanence does funny things to you Hue.,
VO/Purple9,It makes you question... what is real?,
VO/Orange0,"The University gardens were bathed in an earthy, orange light when I first met Dr. Grey.",
VO/Orange1,"Summer had come and gone, and a cold autumnal crispness had caught me off guard.",
VO/Orange2,"I sat on the grass, surrounded by my books and papers, when a cool breeze threatened to blow my notes across the lawn.",
VO/Orange3,A page escaped my reach and took flight.,
VO/Orange4,"A man not much older than myself chased after it, catching it on his third or fourth attempt.",
VO/Orange5,I remember his gentle smile when he returned it.,
VO/Orange6,He started talking and I was surprised that he had read my work in the University journal.,
VO/Orange7,"He said he was a professor, and that... he hoped we could work together someday.",
VO/Orange8,It's funny Hue... how something so small... can change so much.,
VO/Fire0,Dr. Grey soon became my assigned mentor and... I can't help but feel he somehow had a hand in it.,
VO/Fire1,Our fires burnt brightest when we worked together. It felt like we could achieve anything.,
VO/Fire2,We discovered more about colour than I could ever have imagined.,
VO/Fire3,"We split light, mapped spectrums, we painted, we laughed... we worked long hours, and soon our goal became all-consuming.",
VO/Fire4,"We were vessels. The work became more important than us, and we knew it.",
VO/Pink0,"It's funny, I don't remember much after that day on the grass.",
VO/Pink1,I do know that Dr. Grey and I spent many a time together.,
VO/Pink2,"I would compliment him on his work, and his cheeks would flush with a pinkness, hah!",
VO/Pink3,"He'd notice and change the subject, embarrassed.",
VO/Pink4,This work we were doing together... it didn't feel much like work any more.,
VO/Red0,"Did you know, Hue, that every language first has a word for black and for white, for dark and for light?",
VO/Red1,The first colour described afterwards is always... red. The colour of blood and wine. The colour of anger.,
VO/Red2,"The anger I felt... when, I was told my experiments had gone too far.",
VO/Red3,"When Dr. Grey sided with the University, stopping my research altogether.",
VO/Red4,"For all our languages, for all our ways to communicate, it's funny how sometimes we simply cannot.",
VO/Red5,It leads people to do things they regret.,
VO/Red6,"To steal, to break, to forget what is important.",
VO/Temple0,"Once a seed has taken root, it doesn't take long for it to grow, to nurture and blossom into something beautiful.",
VO/Temple1,"The seed of knowledge was planted in my mind, and I wasn't prepared to let it wilt and die.",
VO/Temple2,The University claimed my experiments were unethical. That altering the fabric of our reality was dangerous.,
VO/Temple3,They were unflinching. My research was confiscated and my contract terminated.,
VO/Temple4,"Following my expulsion, I was left with no choice but to uproot, and move us both far away.",
VO/Temple5,"I knew of a small fishing village, a boat ride from The University, where I hoped my reputation wouldn't precede me.",
VO/Temple6,"You and I moved into a humble home, which is now where you've spent most of your childhood.",
VO/Blue0,"Do you recall those dusty old tomes that used to sit on my desk? The ancient scriptures, of civilisations lost?",
VO/Blue1,"I spent hours poring over them, searching for clues to support my research.",
VO/Blue2,"Aside from their wonders, one thing stood out above all else... blue. Or more specifically, the absence of it.",
VO/Blue3,"Other colours were detailed at length; but not blue, it was never mentioned at all. The word simply didn’t exist.",
VO/Blue4,"Could they not distinguish blue? Without a word to describe it, how can we be sure they could see it at all?",
VO/Yellow0,Spring was around the corner. Yellow daffodils poked through the dirt in our backyard.,
VO/Yellow1,"As time moved, my resentment slowly slipped away.",
VO/Yellow2,"I continued my research from home. Without Dr. Grey, work was slow, but I still made progress.",
VO/Yellow3,"One day, Hue, when you were sleeping... I watched over you.",
VO/Yellow4,"I was on the cusp of a breakthrough, and you were the last person left to see it.",
VO/Yellow5,I was so excited... for the both of us.,
VO/Tech0,My research led me to tales of a long lost civilisation.,
VO/Tech1,They built great machines... pioneering electricity many years before we discovered it.,
VO/Tech2,"Strangely though, this civilisation is said to have felt no pain.",
VO/Tech3,"They knew of pain, and observed it, yet could not experience it themselves.",
VO/Tech4,"Explaining to them the sensation of pain, is like me explaining colour...",
VO/Tech5,...to someone that can only see in black and white.,
VO/Tech6,"I wonder Hue, if we will be able to share in our experiences of colour.",
VO/Lime0,The first time I wore the ring... I could see a coloured image of the sun.,
VO/Lime1,"Aqua, purple, orange, pink, red, blue, yellow and green.",
VO/Lime2,Great fireworks played out across the backdrop to my reality.,
VO/Lime3,"Was I dreaming? Was I alive? My senses, dulled from a lifetime of monotone, struggled with the revelation.",
VO/Lime4,Time eased. Colours danced in slow motion... like Pollock painting a ballet on the moon.,
VO/Lime5,I removed the ring and time slipped back to normal.,
VO/Lime6,"Colour dissolved into grey. It was overwhelming, but what followed affected me the most.",
VO/Lime7,"After seeing in colour for the first time, when everything returned to normal, I could remember in colour.",
VO/Lime8,I had never once before had a coloured memory.,
VO/TechEnd0,"The more I experienced, the more I realised how little I was experiencing.",
VO/TechEnd1,"Seeing the world in true colour, was not true at all.",
VO/TechEnd2,The goalposts had just been moved a little further down an infinite playing field.,
VO/TechEnd3,"These shades... they are a paradigm away from what I could ever imagine, and yet, how much more there must be! ",
VO/TechEnd4,"Is there ever such a thing as true reality, Hue? Does truth exist in our minds, the same way that colour does?",
VO/TechEnd5,Maybe next I'll stumble upon a third-dimension. Hah! Could you imagine?!,
VO/Mountains0,"If a tree stands in the woods, and nobody is there to see it, does that tree exist?",
VO/Mountains1,Does it have colour and form? Does it matter?,
VO/Mountains2,"This journey has been difficult, Hue, and whilst I have trodden a lost, winding path...",
VO/Mountains3,...I feel no closer to the truth I was after. No matter how long you chase the moon...,
VO/Mountains4,"If truth does exist in our minds, then I feel there may be one that I have neglected.",
VO/Mountains5,"All this time, you've been alone, and now uprooted, on a journey for my cause.",
VO/Mountains6,For what? So I could see the world a little clearer?,
VO/Mountains7,"I do hope in the end, it was worth it. For both of us.",
VO/UniversityStart0,"Being back at the University has surfaced many memories, Hue.",
VO/UniversityStart1,I remember taking you to lectures... you would crawl to the front of the hall when I wasn’t paying attention.,
VO/UniversityStart2,"Dr. Grey would look down from his lectern, and all his seriousness and authority would wash away.",
VO/UniversityStart3,"He would pick you up, walk over and return you to my arms with a smile.",
VO/UniversityStart4,"Love cannot be measured, Hue. Like colour, it exists inside of us. I buried it.",
VO/UniversityStart5,"I buried the love that I had, for my own ends. I hope, after all this, you will see my mistakes for what they are.",
VO/UniversityStart6,"Yours lovingly, Mum.",
VO/UniversityEnd0,"Dearest Hue, it has been too long. You have grown so much.",
VO/UniversityEnd1,Your mother... I tried to warn her.,
VO/UniversityEnd2,I thought that exiling her from the University would protect her... would protect you...,
VO/UniversityEnd3,She did not understand that some people choose not to see.,
VO/UniversityEnd4,"I never stole the ring from her, Hue. I tried to destroy it... before it destroyed her.",
VO/UniversityEnd5,I now know she had it under control. She knew what she was doing.,
VO/UniversityEnd6,"My intervention shattered the ring, altering your mother's very fabric.",
VO/UniversityEnd7,"My only reprieve, is that you were able to follow in her footsteps... to experience her work first-hand.",
VO/UniversityEnd8,"We do not see things as they are Hue, instead we see them as we are.",
VO/UniversityEnd9,Your mother... she has been waiting for you. I expect she will be thrilled to see how far you've come.,
VO/PS0,"P.S. You cannot always control what happens to you, but you can choose how you see it.",
VO/PS1,"Now you can see true colour, you must decide if it is for better or worse.",
VO/PS2,"I hope, after all this, it is for the better.",
